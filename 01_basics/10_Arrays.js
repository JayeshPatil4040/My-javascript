// Javascript arrays are resizeble and they content mix of different data types
//JavaScript arrays are not associative arrays and so, array elements cannot be accessed using arbitrary strings as indexes.
//JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1.
//Javascript arrays copy operation creates a SHELLOW COPY rather than DEEP COPY
// 1) : Shellow copy - Shellow copy means any changes we make in orignal array it will also change orignal array.
//2)  : Deep copy - Deep copy means any changes we make in orignal array it will not change the orignal array
